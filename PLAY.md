## What AI can do now
It's so limited, and we'll add a lot in the future

+ move to somewhere by A* pathfinding
+ collect food, if there isn't any nearby, then A* find a position to collect
+ collect material, if there isn't any nearby, then A* find a position to collect
+ response the player's words, and react as a real man, change his behaviors, and also chat with player
+ drop some item in bag
+ interact with nearby people(sharing food and exchange items may happen)
+ chat with anyone
+ give assined item to anyone
+ craft items
+ build structures


So if you have enough persuasiveness, you can even let them divide the work and collaborate, collect resources and concentrate them in the hands of builders and craftsmen, quickly manufacture various buildings, and obtain basic weapons and equipment, etc.

## Items can craft
+ some weapons
+ some armors
+ some potions
+ many materials

when in bag, they will be auto equipped, better ones will replace the old ones.

## Builings can build
+ field, havest many foods later, just wait some days, and walk on it (auto harvest).
+ wall, protect your area, monsters cannot pass the wall.
+ trap, hurt the monster. you may need build many traps.

## Rules in This Level of Backrooms
This is a small world with 1000 * 1000 grids, where neatly stacked materials form the walls.

After a period of time, the terrain in some areas will change, and a group of survivors will come here, as well as some food piles.

If humans die from hunger here, they will turn into monsters.
People can search for food, dismantle walls to obtain materials, freely plant, manufacture items, and build to combat hunger and monsters, and ensure their long-term survival and continuous development.
