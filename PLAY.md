## What AI can do now
It's so limited, and we'll add a lot in the future

+ collect food, if there isn't any nearby, then A* find a position to collect
+ collect material, if there isn't any nearby, then A* find a position to collect
+ response the player's words, and react as a real man, change his behaviors, and also chat with player
+ drop some item in bag
+ interact with nearby people(sharing food and exchange items may happen)
